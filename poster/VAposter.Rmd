# Introduction and Motivation

**Background**<br>
Forensic Analysis has proliferated into digital forensics which involves transforming data into insightful information to aid investigations. Searching through data such as credit card and travel data, law enforcement agencies can quickly seek out anormalies and identify suspects.By creating forensic tools with interactive visualization and automated analysis techniques, digital data can be presented in meaningful ways. Reflecting on this, we designed and developed a Forensic Investigation App (FIA), an interactive dashboard that allows law enforcement agents to conduct investigative analysis of GPS and merchant card data. 

**Objective**<br>
To develop an interactive tool that simplifies data exploration and analysis, providing valuable insights into the behaviours of individuals by leveraging their digital trail. The study is built on VAST Mini Challenge 2's task to find unusual patterns in GASTech employees credit card records and GPS tracking records of their cars. 

**Design Principles**<br>

- <u>Simplicity and Clarity</u> - Aesthetically clean, easy to configure visuals and seamless user experience.
- <u>Interactivity</u> - Provide the flexibility for the user to customize visuals and explore data.
- <u>Utility</u> - Perform exploratory and inferential data analysis, supported by different visualisations.

**Data Sources**<br>
Data was obtained from Mini-Challenge 2 within the annual IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge 2021. The data includes i) csv files of vehicle tracking,credit card and loyalty card purchases of the GASTech employees two weeks before the disappearance of several employees; and ii) geo-spatial files of the island.Data was cleaned and transformed in R using base R and the dplyr package. These activities are done by server and hidden from the user.


**Analytical Approach**<br>
The interactive tool aims to address the following analysis requirements:
(1)	Are mean spends of the locations and individuals statistically different?
(2)	How many visitors went to locations A, B, C and D at a certain hour and who?
(3)	What is the visit frequency of a specific staff to a particular location?
(4)	Can either the staff or the locations be clustered into groups, based on similarity?
(5)	How long did a staff stay in a particular location on a particular day? 
(6)	Were there any staff who exhibited similar movement patterns? 
(7)	How does expenditure at locations link people? 
(8)	Which are the locations of importance within the networks?

**Application Overview**<br>
FIA is an interactive tool developed using Shiny and various R packages ggplot2,tidyverse and heatmaply, to build interactive web apps. Users are able to customise visualisations and within the application. The application is reproducible, and can distributed easily.

# Analysis and Insights
\vspace{-100pt}
#### Case Study: VAST Mini Challenge 2
\vspace{-100pt}
**Interactive ANOVA**<br>
The *timetk* package was used to provide diagnostic plots to study trends, seasonality and
remainder, anomalies and lag if present in the time-series.
\vspace{-100pt}
```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
#knitr::include_graphics("images/cases-etsUI.jpg")
```
\vspace{-100pt}
**Interactive Upset Plot**<br>
The focus here is to allow users to compare and assess the performance of the predictive models
provided. The tool allows the user to explore and compare models available for predictive time-series analysis. The tool also allows advanced users to change more advanced parameters.
\vspace{-100pt}
```{r pressure3, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
#knitr::include_graphics("x.jpg")
```
\vspace{-100pt}


**Interactive Heat Map with Dendrogram**<br>
The scatterplot from *ggstatsplot* package was chosen for the statistical tests conducted on the variables.
\vspace{-100pt}
```{r pressure4, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
#knitr::include_graphics("x.jpg")
```
\vspace{-100pt}
**Interactive Spatial Map **<br>
The *ggplot2* package was used to generate the funnel plot, which is more appropriate for death rate analysis.
\vspace{-100pt}

```{r pressure5, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
#knitr::include_graphics("x.jpg")
```
\vspace{-100pt}

**Interactive Network Graph - Eigenvector Analysis**<br>
The *olsrr* package was used to generate the UI for the multivariate analysis, which is more appropriate for exploring relationships with multiple independent variables.
\vspace{-100pt}

```{r pressure6, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
#::include_graphics("x.jpg")
```
\vspace{-100pt}


**Interactive Network Graph - Degree Analysis**<br>
The *olsrr* package was used to generate the UI for the multivariate analysis, which is more appropriate for exploring relationships with multiple independent variables.
