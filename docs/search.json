In January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech celebrated their new-found fortune from the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of the celebration, several employees of GAStech went missing. Mini-Challenge 2 has provided vehicle tracking data and credit card purchases and preferences as recorded on loyalty cards of the GASTech employees 2 weeks before the disappearance to support the investigation.\r\nThe objective of this challenge is make use of visual analytics to identify which GASTech employees made which purchases and identify suspicious patterns of behavior from the datasets. We will make use of R and its packages, which are open-source and free, to visualize the data to make our findings accessible and replicable.\r\nDatasets\r\nThere are 4 datasets provided:\r\nCredit card data: transaction of each credit card with time stamp, price and location\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ncc_data <- read_csv(\"data/cc_data.csv\")\r\nhead(cc_data,5)\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 5 x 4\r\n  timestamp        location            price last4ccnum\r\n  <chr>            <chr>               <dbl>      <dbl>\r\n1 01/06/2014 07:28 Brew've Been Served 11.3        4795\r\n2 01/06/2014 07:34 Hallowed Grounds    52.2        7108\r\n3 01/06/2014 07:35 Brew've Been Served  8.33       6816\r\n4 01/06/2014 07:36 Hallowed Grounds    16.7        9617\r\n5 01/06/2014 07:37 Brew've Been Served  4.24       7384\r\n\r\nLoyalty card data: transaction on loyalty card with date, price and location\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nloyalty_data <- read_csv(\"data/loyalty_data.csv\")\r\nhead(loyalty_data,5)\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 5 x 4\r\n  timestamp  location            price loyaltynum\r\n  <chr>      <chr>               <dbl> <chr>     \r\n1 01/06/2014 Brew've Been Served  4.17 L2247     \r\n2 01/06/2014 Brew've Been Served  9.6  L9406     \r\n3 01/06/2014 Hallowed Grounds    16.5  L8328     \r\n4 01/06/2014 Coffee Shack        11.5  L6417     \r\n5 01/06/2014 Hallowed Grounds    12.9  L1107     \r\n\r\nGPS data: latitude and longitude of each employee vehicle (ID) when in movement\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ngps <- read_csv(\"data/gps.csv\")\r\nhead(gps,5)\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 5 x 4\r\n  Timestamp              id   lat  long\r\n  <chr>               <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\r\n1 01/06/2014 06:28:01    35  36.1  24.9\r\n2 01/06/2014 06:28:01    35  36.1  24.9\r\n3 01/06/2014 06:28:03    35  36.1  24.9\r\n4 01/06/2014 06:28:05    35  36.1  24.9\r\n5 01/06/2014 06:28:06    35  36.1  24.9\r\n\r\nCar assignment data: full name of employee and ID of car assigned\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ncars <- read_csv(\"data/car-assignments.csv\")\r\nhead(cars,5)\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 5 x 5\r\n  LastName FirstName CarID CurrentEmploymentType CurrentEmploymentTit~\r\n  <chr>    <chr>     <dbl> <chr>                 <chr>                \r\n1 Calixto  Nils          1 Information Technolo~ IT Helpdesk          \r\n2 Azada    Lars          2 Engineering           Engineer             \r\n3 Balas    Felix         3 Engineering           Engineer             \r\n4 Barranco Ingrid        4 Executive             SVP/CFO              \r\n5 Baza     Isak          5 Information Technolo~ IT Technician        \r\n\r\nSteps Involved\r\nGetting a better sense of the spatio temporal data (credit card, loyalty and GPS)\r\nCleaning, transforming and merging the data\r\nChoosing the best visualisations and R packages (maps or otherwise) for insight gathering\r\nAllowing pre-determined inputs to allow flexibility and interactivity of the data and its visualisations\r\nEngaging the reader to explore these visualisations on-demand within an RShiny app\r\nDrafting poster for an overview of the process from scoping to actual implementation of the RShiny app\r\nUsing R to Visualise Spatio Temporal Data\r\nOverview on Previous Works\r\nVAST Challenge 2021 made use of the same dataset that was used for VAST Challenge 2014. Of the 28 submissions for the Mini-Challenge 2 in 2014, many of the winning teams made use of D3.js, a JavaScript library to develop their propriety tools. Some of the teams explored novel approach such as using parallel coordiantes plot, time rings and network graph. However, most common approaches can be summarized as:\r\nTimeline of employeeâ€™s location color coded by location category overlaid with spend\r\nGeospatial map of movement\r\nSpace-time cube of movement\r\nWe would experiment with some of the visualisations above and seek a simpler representation using R, a open-source software, without compromising on the depth of the insights.\r\nApproach by VAST 2014 Mini-Challenge 2 Winning Teams\r\nCentral South University\r\nAnalytical Tools: D3.js, mySQL, Excel\r\nVisualisation: Heatmap, Parallel Coordinates Plot, RadViz, Geospatial Map\r\n\r\nFraunhofer IAIS and City University London\r\nAnalytical Tools: V-Analytics, developed in the Knowledge Discovery department of Fraunhofer IAIS using D3.js\r\nVisualisation: Time Histogram, Geospatial Map, Network Graph with clustering (Semantic space map), Space-time Cube\r\n\r\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\r\nAnalytical Tools: D3.js, Matlab\r\nVisualisation: Space-time Cube, Timeline view, Heatmap\r\n\r\nMiddlesex University\r\nAnalytical Tools: Patterns of Life suite of tools developed by Middlesex University\r\nVisualisation: Timeline view, Geospatial Map, Bar chart\r\n\r\nPeking University\r\nAnalytical Tools: MovementFinder developed by Peking University using Python, D3.js, QGIS\r\nVisualisation: Timeline view with clustering, Geospatial Map with 24-hour ring\r\n\r\nPurdue University\r\nAnalytical Tools: Dodeca-Rings Map developed by Purdue University using HTML5, CSS, SVG, JavaScripts, jQuery, PHP, MySQL and D3\r\nVisualisation: Geospatial Map with dodecagons to show events, Social Relationship Matrix, Activity Temporal Chart\r\n\r\nWhat R Packages Will Be Explored?\r\nData Cleaning and Transformation\r\ntidyverse Manipulation of the three types of data (credit card, loyalty and GPS)\r\ntimetk This package enables time-series visualisation. This includes anomaly detection and seasonality. This could facilitate the analysis to narrow down the suspicious employees.\r\ngeohashTools Allows lat long to be encoded into a short string of letters and digits to know which area on a map a user is within.\r\nInteractive Data Visualisations\r\ntmap Use to plot thematic maps. Thematic maps are geographical maps in which spatial data distributions are visualized.\r\nggplot2 Has a wide range of visualisations that can aid in analytics to understand the movement of the employees and the usage of credit card and loyalty data. Ggplot2 can be used for scatterplots, heatmap, timeseries and network graph visualisations.\r\nplotly Use as a wrapper for ggplot2. Given the need for interactivity to identify the GASTech employees who made suspicious purchases and displayed abnormal patterns of behavior, plotly could be used for tooltips and animations.\r\nggiraph Allows ggplot graphics to be animated using tooltip, hover and on-click to help uncover suspicious activities.\r\nggraph Building on ggplot2, ggraph can provide greater detail and understanding of network data. For example, both credit card spending and car movements can be expressed using network graphs.\r\nInteractive Web App\r\nShiny The use of Shiny allows for greater interaction between the user and the dataset.\r\nData Preparation\r\nData preparation largely follows the Mini-Challenge questions posed:\r\nData Cleaning\r\nCheck that dates and time are recognized correctly by R\r\nCheck that location names are not mis-spelt that create duplicates redundancies\r\nFor car-assignments data, replace car id blanks with 0 to indicate no car id.\r\nMerging Data\r\nMerging Credit Card And Loyalty Data To Form Transactional Dataset: Transactional dataset formed by joining both the credit card and loyalty data on date, location and amounts spent. To accommodate for possible errors in data inputs and difference in spend and time, we will use fuzzy matching to find the closest match between both datasets. This would give an indication of the loyalty number - credit card number relationship. We will also take note of mismatch due to cashbacks or deviation in the time places posted credit card transactions to not attribute suspicious activity to data quality issue.\r\nLocation of Owner Using GPS dataset: Merge GPS dataset with car assignments dataset by ID. This will give an indication of the employeesâ€™ locations by car assignment. Travel patterns of employees assigned vehicles could be used to identify suspicious behavior and narrow down the suspects.\r\nIdentifying Movements By Merging GPS and Transactional Dataset: First, we will identify time pauses within the GPS data to discover where the employees were spending their time at. Then we can perform a visual inspection of these pauses in and their respective locations vis-a-vis the map. In addition, we can match the coordinates during the gps pauses against the location names in the transactional dataset to match the location on the map. This will help to connect the credit card and loyalty card owners to cars assignments.\r\nData Transformation\r\nWe will need to transform the data into the right format for the selected visualisation. For example, edges and nodes will need to be prepared for network graph charts.\r\nShiny Web App Design\r\nGive Users Dexterity To Explore Hypotheses:\r\nSpending Patterns: The first page of the Shiny app will identify popular locations using credit and loyalty data. The user should be able to drill into popular locations i) by weekdays vs weekends, ii) by category, iii) by amount, and iv) by hour. Users can flesh out behaviours or spend that seem suspicious (anomaly detection). These credit card and loyalty card numbers will be further investigated in the next page.\r\nDriving Patterns: The second page of the Shiny app seeks to identify suspicious behaviour by travel pattern. Users should be able to view travel patterns by â€˜location to locationâ€™ (node to node) at different time of day. Users can compare travel patterns across different cars or zoom into an individual by filtering using the car id. From this, cars with faulty GPS data will be identified to avoid assigning meaning to data quality issues. Users should be able to i) spot activity at unexpected hours (anomaly detection), ii) identify where the unusual activities are happening on the map, and iii) who else were likely part of the activities.\r\nUnified View of Spend and Driving Patterns: The third page of the Shiny app seeks to identify employees by inferring owners to each credit card and loyalty card. The visual will be able to filter to by car id, employee name, credit card number and loyalty card. The chart will be done in a time-series with i) transactional data (credit card and loyalty card) as the y-axis, date/time as the bottom x-axis, and location as the top x-axis. The analysis should be done with statistical approach using confidence interval/ hypothesis testing. Users should be able to i) see the journey of each employee by the location and type of location they were at, and ii) identify mismatch in location of spending and gps data.\r\nShare Insights from Investigation:\r\nInsights: The last page of the Shiny app seeks to highlight insights gathered from the earlier three pages and flesh out i) unofficial relationships and ii) locations where suspicious activity may be occurring. The page will not be interactive.\r\nAssumptions\r\nTwo Weeks Of Data Prior To The Disappearance Contains Valuable Clues: The challenge only provides these two weeks worth of data and alludes that this dataset showcases suspicious behaviour that are related to the eventual disappearance. It is also possible to suggest that suspicious activities may have occurred outside of these two weeks.\r\nPOI Locations Are Referenced Only From Map Image and Coordinates of Places with Spending: GPS movements through POI locations are visually approximated, after mapping the four corners of the map image onto a coordinate system. No availability of accurate POI coordinates.\r\nLimitations\r\nData Limited To Two Weeks Prior To Incident: Apart from having data two weeks prior to the incident, obtaining data on the day of the incident would be equally, if not more, crucial in uncovering greater insights into what actually happened.\r\nLimited Research On How Errors In Attributes And Locations Influence Both Spatio-Temporal Assessment And Pattern Analysis: The data extracted from the challenge has its own anomalies and its errors may skew its insights.\r\nAdditional POIs Gleamed From GPS Data Missing From Map: There are unknown POIs, derived from pauses in GPS data, that differ from the map. Though some POIs can be assumed as their residential points, other POIs would remain a mystery as to its actual nature.\r\nFuture Scope\r\nUse Of Spatio-Temporal Statistics In Identifying Travel Patterns: Using existing GPS data, we can work a model of how possible a person is likely to be at a particular place at a point in time, given their job position and time of day\r\nTime Series Anomaly Detection By Predictive Confidence Interval Anomalies can be detected using time series modeling. Specifically, building a predictive model using to understand the common trend for each employee. The predictive model could forecast future values with a confidence band. One suggested approach is to use ARIMA for each employee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
