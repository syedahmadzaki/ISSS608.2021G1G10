Thematic maps are geographical maps in which spatial data distributions are visualized.ggplot2: Has a wide range of visualisations that can aid in analytics to understand the movement of the employees and the usage of credit card and loyalty data. Ggplot2 can be used for heatmap, timeseries and network graph visualisations.tidyverse: Manipulation of the three types of data (credit card, loyalty and GPS)plotly Use as a wrapper for ggplot2. Given the need for interactivity to identify the GASTech employees who made suspicious purchases and displayed abnormal patterns of behavior, plotly could be used for tooltips and annimations.ggraph Building on ggplot2, ggraph can provide greater detail and understanding of network data.timetk This package enables time-series visualisation. This includes anomaly detection and seasonality. This could facilitate the analysis to narrow down the suspicious employees.\r\nData Preparation\r\nData preparation largely follows the Mini-Challenge questions posed:\r\n1. Data Cleaning\r\nCheck that dates are recognized correctly by R\r\nCheck that location names are not mis-spelt that create duplicates redundancies\r\nFor car-assignments data, replace car id blanks with 0 to indicate no car id.\r\n2. Merging Data\r\nMerging Credit Card And Loyalty Data To Form Transactional Dataset: Transactional dataset formed by merging both the credit card and loyalty data by timestamp, location and amounts spent. To accommodate for possible errors in data inputs, we will use fuzzy matching to find the closest match between both datasets. This would give an indication of the loyalty number - credit card number relationship.\r\nSub-Title??: Timeseries by transactional dataset formed by merging transactional data with GPS data. This would give an indication of the location by credit card number. (How do you merge this, and what can be found in this?)\r\nIdentifying Movements Through Merging GPS and Transactional Dataset: First, we’ll identify time pauses within the GPS data. Then we’ll perform a visual inspection of these pauses in time and their respective locations vis-a-vis the map. From there, we can then match it against the transactional dataset to identify the car assignments.\r\nUser Takeaways\r\nAllowing Users To Ask The Right Questions: Manipulating the data in a form that can be visualized on an interactive platform would allow the user to explore the data in greater detail. For a visual detective, this is key in uncovering anomalies or trends into what might have happened prior to the disappearances.\r\nABC\r\nAssumptions\r\nTwo Weeks Of Data Prior To The Disappearance Contains Valuable Clues: The challenge only provides these two weeks worth of data and alludes that this dataset showcases suspicious behaviour that are related to the eventual disappearance. It is also possible to suggest that suspicious activities may have occurred outside of these two weeks.\r\nPOI Locations Are Referenced Only From Map Image, And Not Through Exact Coordinates: GPS movements through POI locations are visually approximated, after mapping the four corners of the map image onto a coordinate system. No availability of accurate POI coordinates.\r\nLimitations\r\nData Limited To Two Weeks Prior To Incident: Apart from having data two weeks prior to the incident, obtaining data on the day of the incident would be equally, if not more, crucial in uncovering greater insights into what actually happened.\r\nLimited Research On How Errors In Attributes And Locations Influence Both Spatio-Temporal Assessment And Pattern Analysis: The data extracted from the challenge has its own anomalies and its errors may skew its insights.\r\nAdditional POIs Gleamed From GPS Data Missing From Map: There are unknown POIs, derived from pauses in GPS data, that differ from the map. Though some POIs can be assumed as their residential points, other POIs would remain a mystery as to its actual nature.\r\nFuture Scope\r\nUse Of Spatio-Temporal Statistics In Identifying Travel Patterns: Using existing GPS data, we can work a model of how possible a person is likely to be at a particular place at a point in time, given their job position and time of day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
