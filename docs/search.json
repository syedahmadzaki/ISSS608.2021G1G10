Getting a better sense of the spatio temporal data (credit card, loyalty and GPS)\r\n2. Cleaning the data and choosing the best visualisations (maps or otherwise) for insight gathering\r\n3. Allowing pre-determined inputs to allow flexibility and reactivity of the data and its visualisations\r\n4. Engaging the reader to explore these visualisations on-demand within an RShiny app\r\n5. Drafting poster for an overview of the process from scoping to actual implementation of the RShiny app\r\nUsing R to Visualise Spatio Temporal Data\r\nOverview on Previous Works\r\nABC\r\nWhat R Packages will be used?\r\nShiny: The use of Shiny allows for greater interaction between the user and the dataset. ggplot: Has a wide range of visualisations tidyverse: Manipulation of the three types of data (credit card, loyalty and GPS) added more packages as a test for this*\r\nData Preparation\r\nData preparation largely follows the Mini-Challenge questions posed:\r\n1. Merging both the credit card and loyalty data to form total transactional data.\r\n2. This transactional data would then be merged with the GPS data.\r\nUser Takeaways\r\nAllowing Users To Ask The Right Questions: Manipulating the data in a form that can be visualized on an interactive platform would allow the user to explore the data in greater detail. For a visual detective, this is key in uncovering anomalies or trends into what might have happened prior to the disappearances.\r\nABC\r\nAssumptions\r\nTwo Weeks Of Data Prior To The Disappearance Contains Valuable Clues: The challenge only provides these two weeks worth of data and alludes that this dataset showcases suspicious behaviour that are related to the eventual disappearance. It is also possible to suggest that suspicious activities may have occurred outside of these two weeks.\r\nPOI Locations Are Referenced Only From Map Image, And Not Through Exact Coordinates: GPS movements through POI locations are visually approximated, after mapping the four corners of the map image onto a coordinate system. No availability of accurate POI coordinates.\r\nLimitations\r\nData Limited To Two Weeks Prior To Incident: Having the data on the day of the incident would be crucial in uncovering greater insights into what actually happened.\r\nLimited Research On How Errors In Attributes And Locations Influence Both Spatio-Temporal Assessment And Pattern Analysis: The data extracted from the challenge has its own anomalies and its errors may skew its insights.
