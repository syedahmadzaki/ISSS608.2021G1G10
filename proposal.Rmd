## Project Proposal  
Our project is based on Mini-Challenge 2 within VAST Challenge 2021, where it specifically deals with an analysis of movement and tracking data.  

Steps Involved:  
1.	Getting a better sense of the spatio temporal data (credit card, loyalty and GPS)  
2.	Cleaning the data and choosing the best visualisations (maps or otherwise) for insight gathering  
3.	Allowing pre-determined inputs to allow flexibility and reactivity of the data and its visualisations  
4.	Engaging the reader to explore these visualisations on-demand within an RShiny app  
5.	Drafting poster for an overview of the process from scoping to actual implementation of the RShiny app  

## Using R to Visualise Spatio Temporal Data
### Overview on Previous Works
ABC

### What R Packages will be used?


**Shiny:** The use of Shiny allows for greater interaction between the user and the dataset.
**ggplot2:** Has a wide range of visualisations that can aid in analytics to understand the movement of the employees and the usage of credit card and loyalty data. Ggplot2 can be used for heatmap, timeseries and network graph visualisations. 
**tidyverse:** Manipulation of the three types of data (credit card, loyalty and GPS) 
**plotly** Used as a wrapper for ggplot2. Given the need for interactivity to identify the GASTech employees who made suspicious purchases and displayed abnormal patterns of behavior, plotly could be used for tooltips and annimations.
**ggraph** Building on ggplot2, ggraph can provide greater detail and understanding of network data
**timetk** This package enables time-series visualisation. This includes anomaly detection and seasonality. This could facilitate the analysis to narrow down the suspicious employees.


## Data Preparation  
Data preparation largely follows the Mini-Challenge questions posed:  
1. Data cleaning: 
a. Check that location names are not mis-spelt that create duplicates redundancies
b. For car-assignments data, replace car id blanks with 0 to indicate no car id. 

2. Merging both the credit card and loyalty data to form total transactional data.  
2.	This transactional data would then be merged with the GPS data.  

## User Takeaways  
1.	**Allowing Users To Ask The Right Questions:** Manipulating the data in a form that can be visualized on an interactive platform would allow the user to explore the data in greater detail. For a visual detective, this is key in uncovering anomalies or trends into what might have happened prior to the disappearances.  
2.	**ABC**  

## Assumptions  
1.	**Two Weeks Of Data Prior To The Disappearance Contains Valuable Clues:** The challenge only provides these two weeks worth of data and alludes that this dataset showcases suspicious behaviour that are related to the eventual disappearance. It is also possible to suggest that suspicious activities may have occurred outside of these two weeks.  
2.	**POI Locations Are Referenced Only From Map Image, And Not Through Exact Coordinates:** GPS movements through POI locations are visually approximated, after mapping the four corners of the map image onto a coordinate system. No availability of accurate POI coordinates.  

## Limitations  
1.	**Data Limited To Two Weeks Prior To Incident:** Having the data on the day of the incident would be crucial in uncovering greater insights into what actually happened.  
2.	**Limited Research On How Errors In Attributes And Locations Influence Both Spatio-Temporal Assessment And Pattern Analysis:** The data extracted from the challenge has its own anomalies and its errors may skew its insights.

## Future Scope  
1. Test push
